# Welcome Creators

Welcome to the official Flaunch documentation, where **creators own the revenue** and **coins are automatically bought back**.

Creators can create _new coins_ or _import existing ones_ to benefit from the Flaunch tech stack. Finally, any coin created or imported to Flaunch can be Grouped together to create economic systems for their community and followers.
