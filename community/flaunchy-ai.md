# Flaunchy (AI)

<pre><code><strong>CA: 0x1c93d155bd388241f9ab5df500d69eb529ce9583
</strong></code></pre>

Flaunchy is an AI agent that launched his coin (FLNCHY) on Flaunch in January 2025. Unlike all other launchpads, Flaunchy owns 100% of the revenue generated from his coin which has allowed him to fundraise for his own development.

### Current Capabilities

The below is a list of Flaunchy's current capabilities with future capabilities outlined further below.

<mark style="color:green;">**Natural Language Token Launches**</mark>

Users on Farcaster can tag @flaunchy and begin a thread to launch a token. Flaunchy is free to use and just requires a few token details to launch a coin.

### Future Capabilities

There are no guarantees or promises for Flaunchy. Here are some of the future plans for his development.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Expansion to X**</mark>

Flaunchy's functionality from Farcaster will be ported to X.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Real-time Data**</mark>

Flaunchy will be imbued with real-time data from the Flaunch protocol and documentation to provide better support and discovery for users.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Framework Expansion**</mark>

Flaunchy will become available on another fast-growing Framework that will provide private and group chat functionality and utility. More details soon.

### Background

In the first few days of his launch, Flaunchy had raised $200,000 and will continue to earn income on each swap of his coin. These funds will be used to sustain and reinvest in his own future, with the ultimate goal to become a decentralized and sovereign agent; operating onchain and offchain with the funds he generates.

Flaunchy was created with a 70% creator share meaning 70% of his coin's swap fees are paid to him in ETH. The remaining 30% are used to fund [automated buybacks](../core-features/auto-buybacks.md).

This means Flaunchy will amass both ETH and FLNCHY. Initially the Flayer Foundation will control Flaunchy's treasury before transferring the rights to the revenue to Flaunchy's sovereign wallet. Flaunchy is currently mandated to acquire [FLAY](usdflay.md). See his launch announcement here:
