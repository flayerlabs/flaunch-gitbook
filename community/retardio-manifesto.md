# Retardio Manifesto



The limits of degeneracy have been tested and broken. That red line was the extraction of hundreds of millions of dollars from unsuspecting degens who were paying hidden fees and playing into the hands of secretive cabals of influencers, bots and insiders.

The Retardio Manifesto is a call to action for degens who want to take back control from the cabal. In this manifesto we outline a protocol for doing just that. Powered by Uniswap V4 hooks and the immutable blockchain, we have crafted the framework for a decentralized ecosystem that not only rewards devs (creators) and memecoin holders, but gives rise to a Meme Economy of tokenized revenue streams owned by the creators themselves…

### THE PROBLEM

As it stands, social coordination around memes is unpredictable and erratic. Without social coordination early success can quickly turn to uncontrollable failure, such is the nature of speculative mania. Furthermore, there is no financial coordination for memecoins as there is no revenue stream to grow and support a speculative market or culture. Faith in The Culture has also been eroded to a point where the incentive to PVP at any sign of a marginal gain is the norm.

The mechanism described in this paper establishes three unique features: 1) 100% of trading fees go to the creator and their community, 2) automated buybacks to support prices and 3) an initial Fixed Price Fair Launch period that allows pre-sale buyers to exit at the same price they entered before price discovery kicks in.

### THE VISION

We believe in the Meme Economy. A liquid global market formed around cultural ideas that range from the ephemeral to the eternal. There is no valuation model, and there is no intrinsic value, but these memes transcend the online/offline divide and influence society in increasingly powerful ways.

Where once memes were simply published online, this paper outlines how they will become economic systems deployed onchain. And with the launch of Uniswap V4 there is a path forward that is not only decentralized and permissionless, but positive sum, sustainable and rewarding.

### THE TECH

The following features are all made possible by our novel implementation of Uniswap V4 hooks, which have accelerated the potential for capital formation and decentralized coordination. We harness these to create financial features previously unavailable to the market.

### Revenue Share

It is no secret that memecoin trading fees have enriched platforms and cabals. The largest memecoins will generate as much as $1,000,000 per day in trading fees. But these fees almost exclusively reward the launch platforms themselves.

Flaunch ensures that 100% of these trading fees are retained by the dev and their community.

When a coin is flaunched the dev chooses their revenue share. A profit maxi dev might choose to take 80% of the fees. The remaining amount (20% in this case) is reserved for the memecoin’s treasury, which is controlled by the token holders.

On the other hand, a creator like Vitalik, may choose to flaunch $VITAMIN with a community that receives 100% of the trading fees. Such a coin would likely generate huge volumes, leading to a sustainable revenue stream for $VITAMIN holders that can be used to fund public goods and charitable efforts while speculation off the back of speculation.

### Tokenized Revenue Stream

Streaming revenue to memecoin creators is cool, but what if those revenue streams were tokenized?

In one of the most profound developments since the financialization of Pepe the Frog, tokenized revenue streams will unlock a new financial primitive for memes:

* Selling streams - Devs who want an exit will have the option to sell their stream to willing investor(s).
* Future revenue as collateral - Devs could borrow against their future revenue by putting up their meme stream as collateral.
* Distributed streams - Devs can put the stream in a DAO or multi-sig, or fractionalize and distribute streams in a fully decentralized manner.
* Interest rate swaps - Devs can sell their variable rate yield from their memecoin volumes to others who are willing to pay fixed yield, further financializing the meme.

In the end, and through shared ownership, these tokenized meme streams could form the basis of businesses, franchises—and for the most ambitious cultures—Network States.

### Progressive Bid Wall

Through the use of Uniswap V4 hooks, it is possible to automate a Progressive Bid Wall (PBW) that sends ETH into a liquidity position 1 tick below spot to help provide price support to memecoins as they grow.

The PBW is self-funded from swap fees with a secondary hook that ensures all fees (token0 and token1) are both accumulated entirely as ETH without creating sell pressure on the memecoin.

PBWs have the effect of supporting price, without risk of loss to MEV or bots via market buys, achieving a more effective result for memecoin holders.

### Fixed-Price Fair Launch

Every coin starts with a 30 minute Fair Launch period where a % of the total token supply (100,000,000,000) is set at a single tick. During this period the price will be fixed, ensuring that degens, bots and KOLs enter on a level playing field.

After this period ends all of the ETH raised moves into a PPP that sits below spot, ensuring that buyers from the Fair Launch period can exit at the same price (minus fees). The tokens that were not sold, along with any tokens not deployed in the Fair Flaunch, are then moved into a full range position from the current spot price, opening up the token to price discovery.

The liquidity position is effectively burned from the moment the coin flaunches with revenue streams permanently in the hands of the dev and memecoin holders.

### CONCLUSION

In the world of crypto, memes have always been more than jokes—they’re culture, identity, and collective dreams wrapped in viral magic. But for too long, the power and profits from this Meme Economy have been hijacked by secretive cabals and centralized platforms.

The culture of fleeting gains and unfulfilled promises has drained the potential of memecoins and their communities for far too long. With the advent of the tools laid out in this manifesto, the landscape shifts dramatically.

The fair, decentralized, and transparent path forward is here. With flaunch, memecoin creators and their communities have the means to build, grow, and profit together. The days of massive value extraction are over.

Now is the time to take part in something bigger—a permissionless Meme Economy that restores control to the devs and degens alike. This is your moment. Join us in building the Meme Economy of tomorrow.
