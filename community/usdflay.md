# $FLAY

```
CA (Ethereum) : 0xf1a7000000950c7ad8aff13118bb7ab561a448ee

The Flaunch protocol has the option for a fee switch that can be turned on by FLAY holders through onchain governance. The fee switch, if activated through approval by FLAY holders, would collect up to 10% of the Flaunch protocol's trading fees.

The governance steps for activating the fee switch will be documented after launch on Base mainnet.

With a total supply of `1,000,000,000` tokens, `FLAY` has been carefully distributed to ensure long term sustainability and fair governance.

### **Treasury Allocation** : 30% (`300,000,000 FLAY`) <a href="#treasury-allocation--30-300000000-flay" id="treasury-allocation--30-300000000-flay"></a>

* **Onchain Governance** : 20% (`200,000,000 FLAY`) controlled by the DAO, with onchain governance to be established. These tokens will be used for future incentives or initiatives, subject to community votes and will remain non-circulating until unlocked by future DAO governance.
* **Foundation-Controlled Reserves** : 6% (`60,000,000 FLAY`) reserved for operational uses, such as liquidity provision, growth initiatives, and hiring future contributors.
* **Token Liquidity** : 4% (`40,000,000 FLAY`) used for liquidity provision on centralized and decentralized exchanges.

### **Flayer Contributors** : 20% (`200,000,000 FLAY`) <a href="#flayer-contributors--20-200000000-flay" id="flayer-contributors--20-200000000-flay"></a>

Allocated to Flayer Ecosystem Contributors. These tokens will be unlocked following a 6 month cliff from TGE (25th September 2024) vested over 2.5 years.

In addition to the cliff and vesting period, contributor tokens that have completed both the cliff and vesting periods will only be distributed if the `FLAY` token reaches $75,000,000 FDV (based on a 7-day time-weighted average, per CoinGecko). This unlock schedule will ensure that contributors are fully aligned with the project's long-term growth.

### **FloorDAO & NFTX Token Migration** : 50% (`500,000,000 FLAY`) <a href="#floordao--nftx-token-migration--50-500000000-flay" id="floordao--nftx-token-migration--50-500000000-flay"></a>

`FLOOR` and `NFTX` tokens can be swapped for `FLAY` through [migration](https://migrate.flayer.io/).

**NFTX Holders** : Allocated 33.35% (`333,500,000 FLAY`) of the total supply. Of these tokens, the final circulating amount depends on the amount of NFTX tokens migrated.

**FloorDAO Holders** : Allocated 16.65% (`166,500,000 FLAY`) is reserved for FloorDAO holders. Of these tokens, the final circulating amount depends on the amount of FLOOR tokens migrated.
