# Creator Revenue

Swap fees are shared between creators and communities and the split is decided by the creator themselves. The creator can choose to take from 0% up to 100% of the coin's revenue.

{% hint style="info" %}
Revenue split is immutable and cannot be changed after the coin has launched.
{% endhint %}

* For creators, the revenue is streamed on every swap, paid in ETH
* For communities, the revenue is streamed into [auto buybacks](auto-buybacks.md)

The creator can choose to burn the tokens that are automatically bought back, or they can turn off auto buybacks to accumulate ETH that can be spent on market buying the coin.

Revenue streams are fully decentralized and ownership of the “Memestream” is tokenized as an NFT. These NFTs are transferable. You can read about the implications of this in the [Memestream](memestream.md) section.

The right dev, flaunching the right coin, could find themselves with an annual revenue stream in the millions.

If MOTHER had been Flaunched, Iggy would have a multi-million dollar stream of passive income with at least 20% going to coin holders. The same goes for WIF, MOODENG and many, many others. Instead, those revenues were donated to the platform they launched on.

Flaunched coins retain _all_ the value for the coin and creator.
