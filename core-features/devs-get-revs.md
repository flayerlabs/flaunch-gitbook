# Devs Get Revs

Other launchpads extract millions. Flaunch sends it all (100%) back to the trenches.

How those trading fees are shared between creators (devs) and coins is decided by the dev themselves. The dev can choose to take from 0% up to 100% of the coin's revenue.

* For devs, revenues are streamed on every swap and **claimable in ETH**.
* For coins, revenues are used to fill the automated **buybacks**.

Revenue streams are fully decentralized and ownership of the “Meme Stream” is tokenized as an NFT. These NFTs are transferable. You can read about the implications of this in [The Meme Stream](memestream.md) section.

The right dev, flaunching the right coin, could find themselves with an annual revenue stream in the millions.

If MOTHER had been Flaunched, Iggy would have a multi-million dollar stream of passive income with at least 20% going to coin holders. The same goes for WIF, MOODENG and many, many others. Instead, those revenues were donated to the platform they launched on.

Flaunched coins retain _all_ the value for the coin and creator.
