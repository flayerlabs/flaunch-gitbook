# Memestream

When a coin is flaunched the creator (dev) takes ownership of an NFT—The Memestream—which grants the holder rights to the dev's share of the revenue.

By making revenue streams transferable as an NFT, creators can sell their meme's future income to another person, entity or DAO, allowing them to immediately realize future income. It's not just simple NFT trading that is unlocked, but leverage (borrowing against future income) and renting (interest rate swaps) are all possible too.

Memestreams can also be fractionalized or turned into a DAO to create shared ownership of the revenue stream.

Flaunch is providing infrastructure for not just launching memecoins, but a secondary market for memes and MemeFi that ultimately generates more value for creators and memecoin holders alike.

Every Flaunched meme is a 24/7 passive fundraising opportunity, with the most successful coins making as much as 7 figures per day.

### Passive Fundraising and Donations

Selling, leveraging and fractionalizing the Memestream is one way to further generate value from Flaunch, but what about fundraising? Funds passively accrue to the holder of the Memestream passively—so what would you do with those funds?

* Raise $650,000 to put your meme on the Las Vegas Sphere, all without holding a fundraiser.
* Fund community grants and/or hackathons, all onchain.
* Sponsor the next London Milady Rave.
* Raise funds to develop the first meme-founded Network State.

With Flaunch, transferring the Memestream is enough to send all future income of the meme to the recipient—paid in ETH. There are no tokens to dump, and no permission needed.

* Want to fund Ross Ulbricht's legal expenses? Send the Ulbricht family the Memestream.
* Donate to the cause of your community's choice.
* Send the Memestream to vitalik.eth where he can donate on your coin's behalf.
* Looking to fundraise for malaria treatment? Donate the Memestream to charity.

### Community Take Overs (CTOs)

By tokenizing the underlying value of the meme in the Memestream, anyone can put an offer to buy the meme's future income (and management - see below) on secondary markets. This creates a very real CTO market, where devs that abandon their meme can exit with some additional value by selling its Memestream and allowing the community to keep the culture alive (and getting paid to do so).

CTOs on Flaunch are more concrete and meaningful than anywhere else. Furthermore, the Memestream's ownership can be shared across the community through DAOs, multi-sigs and fractionalization.

### Meme Management

In a future release, the holder of the Memestream is also endowed with specific management rights that can help to accelerate their meme's culture and price. These include the ability to market buy their coin, airdrop tokens, or burn tokens they have bought back.
