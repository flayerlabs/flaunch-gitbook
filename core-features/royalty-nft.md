# Royalty NFT

When a coin is flaunched the creator takes ownership of an NFT—The Royalties NFT—which grants the holder rights to the creator's share of the revenue.

By making royalty streams transferable as an NFT, creators can sell their coin's future income to another person, entity or DAO, allowing them to immediately realize future income. It's not just simple NFT trading that is unlocked, but leverage (borrowing against future income) and renting (interest rate swaps) are all possible too.

Royalty streams can also be fractionalized or turned into a DAO to create shared ownership of the revenue stream.

Flaunch is providing infrastructure for not just launching coins, but a secondary market for coins and DeFi that ultimately generates more value for creators and coin holders alike.

Every Flaunched coin is a 24/7 passive fundraising opportunity, with the most successful coins making as much as 7 figures per day.

### Passive Fundraising and Donations

Selling, leveraging and fractionalizing the Royalty stream is one way to further generate value from Flaunch, but what about fundraising? Funds passively accrue to the holder of the Royalty stream passively—so what would you do with those funds?

* Raise $650,000 to put your coin on the Las Vegas Sphere, all without holding a fundraiser.
* Fund community grants and/or hackathons, all onchain.
* Sponsor the next London Milady Rave.
* Raise funds to develop the first coin-founded Network State.

With Flaunch, transferring the Royalty stream is enough to send all future income of the coin to the recipient—paid in ETH. There are no tokens to dump, and no permission needed.

* Donate to the cause of your community's choice.
* Send the Royalty stream to vitalik.eth where he can donate on your coin's behalf.
* Looking to fundraise for malaria treatment? Donate the Royalty stream to charity.

### Coin Management

The holder of the Royalty stream is also endowed with specific management rights that can help to accelerate their coin's culture and price. These include the ability to market buy their coin or burn tokens they have bought back. More actions are being developed to allow for use in liquidity management and airdrops.

### Community Take Overs (CTOs)

By tokenizing the underlying value of the coin in the Royalty stream, anyone can put an offer to buy the coin's future income (and management - see below) on secondary markets. This creates a very real CTO market, where creators that abandon their coin can exit with some additional value by selling its Royalty stream and allowing the community to keep the culture alive (and getting paid to do so).

CTOs on Flaunch are more concrete and meaningful than anywhere else. Furthermore, the Royalty stream's ownership can be shared across the community through DAOs, multi-sigs and fractionalization.
