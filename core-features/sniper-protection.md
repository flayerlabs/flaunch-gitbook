# Sniper Protection

Flaunch has created proprietary technology that allows web2 verification of a user to be embedded in the Flaunch AMM.

Enabling Sniper Protection when launching a coin via the [Flaunch app](https://flaunch.gg/) requires the user to validate a CAPTCHA before being able to swap during the Fair Launch period (5 minutes by default).

This allows the Creator to leverage the power of hardened web2 anti-bot/proof of humanity tooling to create a better initial distribution of the coin.

{% hint style="success" %}
A "per wallet cap" can also be set to facilitate a broader distribution amongst users at launch.
{% endhint %}

If you are a builder, it's possible to create your own custom implementation of Sniper Protection that can use any offchain data to grant access to the Fair Launch period. Reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/flaunch) to discuss implementation.
