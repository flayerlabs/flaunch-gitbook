# Flaunch API

## The Flaunch Subgraph

Flaunch uses multiple subgraphs for indexing and organizing data from the Flaunch smart contracts. These subgraphs are hosted on The Graph decentralised service and can be used to query Flaunch data.

### Versions and Production Endpoints <a href="#versions-and-production-endpoints" id="versions-and-production-endpoints"></a>

Each chain Flaunch has been launch on will have its own dedicated subgraph.

Each subgraph has a dedicated endpoint for querying data, as well as a page on [The Graph explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer?search=flaunch) that exposes the schema and available fields to query.
