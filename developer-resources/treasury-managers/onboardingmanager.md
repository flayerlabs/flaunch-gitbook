# OnboardingManager

Allows an ERC721 to be locked inside an onboarding manager that can be claimed by a designated wallet address when wanted.

Fees will be collected on behalf of an `onboardee` until they claim the ERC721, at which point they will receive a set amount of the fees collected, and the remaining fees will be distributed to holders via an airdrop contract.
