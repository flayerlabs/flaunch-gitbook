Flaunch in seconds.
{% endembed %}

Flaunching a coin takes seconds and costs only $5 to create.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Go to Create Token

Head to [https://flaunch.gg/create](https://flaunch.gg/create) to start creating your token.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add Token Details

This includes the token name, symbol (keep it to 6 characters or less to enable X.com's auto cashtags), and the image for your token.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Set Revenue Split

Use the slider to determine the share of the coin revenue between you and the community. Creators can take as much as 100% of the trading fees (paid every swap). What they don't take goes to [Automated Buybacks](../core-features/auto-buybacks.md).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Set Fee Receiver

Who will receive the dev's share of the trading fees of the token? You can airdrop this to anyoneâ€”an influencer, a politician, a public good, an AI agent... or you can keep it for yourself. The fee receiver is transferrable (as an NFT) and can be sold on secondary markets (see the [Memestream](../core-features/memestream.md)).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Flaunch!

Once you're happy with your token details, click the "Create" button to deploy your token to Base.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### What's the CA?

Copy and share the CA on socials. The first 30 minutes are a Fixed Price Fair Launch, after that period the coin will automatically go into price discovery.

With your coin now in the wild, any trade will generate revenue for you and your community of holders. Get sharing!
