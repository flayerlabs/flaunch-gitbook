# Launch a Group

{% hint style="info" %}
Groups are not yet live. [Follow on X for the latest](https://x.com/flaunchgg).
{% endhint %}

Groups are a fundamentally new way to launch coins. This section does not go into detail about the Groups technology but is a practical guide to launching a Group with some explanation of the benefits.

### **Why launch a Group?**

Put simply, by launching a Group you turn a coin into a coin economy. You can launch a Group for your own coin, or for someone else's coin, and as a Group owner you can choose to take a % fee on all trading activity within that Group.

Once a Group is created, a limitless set of coins can be added either by you, the owner, or by the community, depending on your Group's permissions.

The Group acts as a repository for all cultural assets and derivatives that are created from that Group's IP. The trading fees generated from those assets are either sent to buybacks of the Group Coin or rewarded to stakers of the Group Coin.

### Group Coin

When launching a Group the first thing to decide is what community (coin) is this Group being created for?

The Group Coin is where all cultural value from the Group is captured. From tokenized memes through to creator coins, project tokens and everything inbetween, it can all be added to the Group with the trading fees shared.

### Group Owner Fee

Users can turn on a Group owner fee that diverts 10% of the coin's Creator revenue to the Group owner. The Group owner can be any address; an EOA, multi-sig or custom contract.

The Group owner fee cannot be changed after launch.
{% endhint %}

### Permissions

Group permissions allow owners to decide what is allowed into the Group. Initially, permissions will be either open or closed. An open group allows anyone to add any coin to the group and for the fees to be shared. A closed group allows only the owner to add coins.

{% hint style="info" %}
Permissions are modular and can be changed after creation. If you want a new type of permission please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/flaunch).
{% endhint %}

### Who Owns the Group Assets?

The assets inside a Group can be withdrawn by the Group owner.

In the future it will be possible to deposit coins via sub-Groups, where the ownership rights of the sub-Group are not transferred to the parent Group.
