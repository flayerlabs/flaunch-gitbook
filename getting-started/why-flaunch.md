# Why Flaunch?

Flaunch is a protocol dedicated to maximizing value for Creators.

Value is maximized in three simple ways:

1. 100% of fees are paid to you, the Creator
2. All fees are paid in ETH (not tokens)
3. The rights to these fees are tokenized as an NFT, opening up secondary markets that extend value.

This first two points are straightforward, and unprecedented in the market. But the third is where the magic happens.

### Flaunch Groups

By tokenizing the rights to the coin's fees it's possible to create collections of coins (Groups) where all the trading fees are shared with the creator and community either through staking or automated buybacks.

{% hint style="success" %}
Groups can be created for any ERC20, not just Flaunch coins.
{% endhint %}

Initially the assets deposited into Groups will just be Flaunch positions (trading fee NFTs), but in the future more assets and yield streams will be accepted.

**What else?**

* Fixed price fair launches removes early price risk
* Auto buybacks follow the price as it goes up
* Creators can transfer or donate their meme revenues to better stewards
* Community Take Overs (CTOs) are unlocked by secondary markets

**Give me more!**

* Flaunched memecoins become 24/7 fundraising tools
* Meme revenues are tokenized (ERC721) and composable in DeFi
* Onchain referrals pay swap fees on every trade
