# Why Flaunch?

Other launchpads extract millions. Flaunch sends it all (100%) back to the trenches.

* Devs get paid on every swap, aligning them with the coin's success
* Automated buybacks protect the token price from falling

{% hint style="success" %}
Flaunched coins have a better hit rate thanks to aligned devs and automated buybacks.
{% endhint %}

What else?

* Fixed price fair launches removes early price risk
* Auto buybacks follow the price as it goes up
* Creators can transfer or donate their meme revenues to better stewards
* Community Take Overs (CTOs) are unlocked by secondary markets

Give me more!

* Flaunched memecoins become 24/7 fundraising tools
* Meme revenues are tokenized (ERC721) and composable in DeFi
* Onchain referrals pay swap fees on every trade
