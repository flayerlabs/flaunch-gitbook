### What revenues might I expect from a Flaunched coin? <a href="#what-revenues-might-i-expect" id="what-revenues-might-i-expect"></a>

Let's take a look at some of the outcomes for a profit maxi dev who chooses 80% revenue share, leaving 20% to the community.

If MOTHER had Flaunched, Iggy would be sitting on an annual passive income of >$10,000,000. Instead those funds are being handed over to platform owners.

### How do I collect my revenue? <a href="#how-do-i-collect-my-revenue" id="how-do-i-collect-my-revenue"></a>

Simple. All revenue from all your coins is available as a single ETH claim in the header. Claimable balances are updated in real-time as fees accumulate and reach a threshold of 0.001 ETH.

### Can my rewards be taken away from me? <a href="#can-my-rewards-be-taken-away-from-me" id="can-my-rewards-be-taken-away-from-me"></a>

Flaunch is a decentralized protocol with no central authority that can take your rewards. Your rewards will be claimable and revenues will continue to accumulate no matter what.

In fact, the protocol goes even further to protect your rewards. When you Flaunch a coin you receive an NFT. The owner of the NFT receives the rewards from the coin. What does that mean? You can **sell your revenue streams, borrow against them, or use them however you want**. This is the power of decentralized meme finance.

### How do I sell my revenue stream?

The [Memestream NFT](../core-features/memestream.md) can be traded on any secondary marketplace like Magic Eden or OpenSea. There are no royalties on Memestream sales.

### How are communities rewarded? <a href="#how-are-communities-rewarded" id="how-are-communities-rewarded"></a>

Enough about devs, what's in it for the community? All Flaunched can have up to 100% of the revenue sent to the community. By default, these fees are used exclusively for [Automated Buybacks](../core-features/auto-buybacks.md) that support the token's price from day 1.

The dev can choose to turn off Auto Buybacks and instead begin accumulating ETH that can be used for market buys, airdrops and more. This aspect is called Meme Management and will have a huge impact on how communities coordinate around their coin.

If the community is led by a Galaxy Brain dev, the shared treasury could reach eye watering levels that even the greatest DAOs would not know what to do with.

WIF's fundraise to buy a $650K ad on the Sphere would have been raised in a single day of trading volume had it been Flaunched instead of launched.

### What is the Fixed Price Fair Launch? <a href="#fair-launch-explained" id="fair-launch-explained"></a>

When a coin is Flaunched it starts with an initial 30 minute Fair Launch.

During Fair Launch the price is fixed for everyone for 30 minutes. The ETH raised during the Fair Launch is then placed immediately into a limit buy, ensuring that Fair Launch participants can exit at the same price (minus trading fees).

After Fair Launch the coin moves into price discovery.

### Why can't I sell during Fair Launch? <a href="#why-cant-i-sell-during-fair-launch" id="why-cant-i-sell-during-fair-launch"></a>

The Fair Launch period is only for buying. After Fair Launch any buyers can sell at the same price they entered (minus trading fees).

### How does the Progressive Bid Wall work? <a href="#how-does-the-progressive-plunge-protection-work" id="how-does-the-progressive-plunge-protection-work"></a>

Trading fees are added to the coin's Progressive Bid Wall (PBW) on every swap.

In the case of a coin with 100% community share, all of the trading revenue will go towards filling this PBW which is automatically created for every 0.1 ETH earned.

We add a little Uniswap V4 magic to the PBW as well, with a hook that ensures it moves up to follow the coin's price as it increases â€“ providing additional price support.

### Does Flaunch have a token? <a href="#does-flaunch-have-a-token" id="does-flaunch-have-a-token"></a>

Flaunch is a decentralized protocol with a governance fee switch that is controlled by FLAY holders.

### Does the team take any fees? <a href="#does-the-team-take-any-fees" id="does-the-team-take-any-fees"></a>

No. The team does not take any of the trading fees. FLAY governance can choose to turn on a fee switch that can take a maximum of 10% of the fees.

Instead, the liquidity in the system is lent out via a Uniswap V4 hook and into Aave for an ultra low risk 2% yield. These funds are used to support the Flayer Foundation's growth.

### Is Flaunch audited? <a href="#is-flaunch-audited" id="is-flaunch-audited"></a>

Yes! We have two audits completed by two leading audit firms. Findings and remediations have been published on the links below:

* EnigmaDark audit
* Omniscia audit

### Glossary ðŸ“– <a href="#glossary" id="glossary"></a>

* **Flaunch**: The act of Flaunching a coin on the Flaunch platform. Flaunched coins are upgraded memecoins with 100% revenue share built in.
* **Progressive Bid Wall:** A mechanism where the community's share of revenue is automatically used to support the token price as a bid wallâ€”automatically triggered at every 0.1 ETH revenue.
* **Fixed Price Fair Launch**: The first 30 minutes of a coin launch, where the price is fixed for all buyers.
* **Memestream**: A unique token you receive when you Flaunch a coin. It holds the rights to all revenue streams and Meme Management for that coin.
