# Protocol Audits

During the development of Flaunch we undertook three audits to ensure that the protocol is secure and functions as expected. At each audit we remediated or acknowledged all known issues.

### Audit 1: Omniscia

Omniscia undertook our initial audit. Unfortunately this cannot be shared publicly, but a synopsis extract from the findings has been provided below showing their initial findings.

### Audit 2: Enigma Dark

The first Enigma Dark audit followed on from the Omnisca findings and also reviewed some newly implemented zap logic including flaunch scheduling and premining.

### Audit 3: Enigma Dark

After the initial Enigma Dark audit there was a small raft of changes to optimise flow which were subsequently reaudited.
