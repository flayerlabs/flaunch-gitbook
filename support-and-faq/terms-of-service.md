**PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE BEFORE USING THE WEBSITE.**

### Acceptance of the Terms of Use <a href="#acceptance-of-the-terms-of-use" id="acceptance-of-the-terms-of-use"></a>

These terms of use are entered into by and between you and the Flayer Protocol, a Cayman Islands company (including all affiliates and subsidiaries, collectively referred to as, “Flayer,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these “Terms of Use”), govern your access to and use of flaunch.gg, including, but not limited to, any content, functionality, and services offered on or through flaunch.gg (collectively, the “Website”). Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Website. By using the Website or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Use when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use in addition to our Privacy Policy, incorporated herein by reference and available at \[docs.flaunch.gg/privacy].

If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you must not access or use the Website.

### About the Website <a href="#about-the-website" id="about-the-website"></a>

Our Website is primarily meant to function as access to and use of the Flaunch App.

To use parts of our Website, a user may need to use a third-party, non-custodial wallet software that allows the user to interact with public smart contracts and blockchains. We do not operate, maintain, or provide any wallets or wallet services. We will at no time have any custody or control of any crypto-assets that any user is interacting with. We are not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, lender or borrower.

As part of our Website, you may from time to time gain access to decentralized open-source smart contracts deployed on public blockchains. Our interface is distinct and separate from any of the smart contracts that may be accessed through it, and is merely one of multiple means of accessing such smart contracts. Users can interact with the same smart contracts otherwise directly, including to develop and build their own user interfaces on top of such smart contracts.

Our Website may change and grow in numbers, which may require that we include additional terms for certain new parts of the Website (which, in such event, will be construed as part of the “Website”). We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify or discontinue any parts of the Website at any time and without any liability.

### Who May Use the Website <a href="#who-may-use-the-website" id="who-may-use-the-website"></a>

The Website is offered and available to users who are 13 years of age or older. The Website is not intended for children under 13 years of age. By using the Website, you represent and warrant that you (i) are 13 years of age or older, (ii) are not barred to use the Website under any applicable law, and (iii) are using the Website only for your own personal use. If you do not meet these requirements, you must not access or use the Website.

### Changes to the Terms of Use <a href="#changes-to-the-terms-of-use" id="changes-to-the-terms-of-use"></a>

We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of revised Terms of Use means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

### Accessing the Website and Account Security <a href="#accessing-the-website-and-account-security" id="accessing-the-website-and-account-security"></a>

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON THE DURATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU IN THEIR ENTIRETIES, BUT WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

### Limitation on Liability <a href="#limitation-on-liability" id="limitation-on-liability"></a>

IN NO EVENT WILL FLAYER, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE WEBSITE, ANY WEBSITE LINKED TO THEM, ANY CONTENT ON THE WEBSITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITE, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW WHICH MAY INCLUDE FRAUD.

### Indemnification <a href="#indemnification" id="indemnification"></a>

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Flayer, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Use or your use of the Website, including, but not limited to, any use of the Website’ content, services and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use or your use of any information obtained from the Website.

### Governing Law and Jurisdiction <a href="#governing-law-and-jurisdiction" id="governing-law-and-jurisdiction"></a>

All matters relating to the Website and these Terms of Use and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Cayman Islands without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the Cayman Islands or any other jurisdiction).

Any dispute arising out of or in connection with the Website and these Terms of Use, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”), which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be London, United Kingdom. The language to be used in the arbitration shall be English. You and Flayer agree to submit all Disputes between you and Flayer to individual binding arbitration. “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Flayer that relates to the Website and these Terms of Use.

If a Dispute must be arbitrated, you or Flayer must start arbitration of the Dispute within one (1) year from when the Dispute first arose. If applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than one (1) year after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period. Flayer encourages you to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it. The failure to provide timely notice will bar all claims.

In any Dispute, the arbitrator will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and legal fees awards will be offset.

Any breach by you of these Terms of Use could cause Flayer irreparable harm for which it has no adequate remedies at law. Accordingly, Flayer is entitled to seek specific performance or injunctive relief for any such breach. Nothing in this section will preclude Flayer from seeking specific performance or injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

### Waiver and Severability <a href="#waiver-and-severability" id="waiver-and-severability"></a>

No waiver by Flayer of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Flayer to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.

### Entire Agreement <a href="#entire-agreement" id="entire-agreement"></a>

The Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy and other terms and conditions applicable at the time you access the Website constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Flayer with respect to the Website and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Website.
